# tizenMngr

**tizenMngr is a Tizen TV management app** (TizenBrew module management, full
root app management/installation, and a kernel/root-exploit runner) for
Samsung Tizen smart TVs. Development is **on hold until full, repeatable root
access** is achieved — see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

This repository currently holds the **public documentation** for the security
research that is the prerequisite for the app: findings, analysis, and
methodology only. No exploit code, no live-network specifics, no credentials.

All work was performed on the owner's own device for research purposes.
Tizen 3.0 is EOL (2017); no further firmware patches exist.

## Help wanted: privilege escalation / root

We have a stable **uid-5001** owner-context foothold (widget service command
exec + signed `/usr/bin/node` + kdbus D-Bus), but **root (uid 0) is not
achieved** on FW 1410. The obvious lanes are largely exhausted and documented.
If you work on Samsung TV / Tizen exploitation, kernel 4.1.10, SMACK/kdbus, or
embedded device research, we'd value help on:

1. **Gate-passing launcher** — the app launch pool only accepts callers whose
   SMACK label is exactly `User`, `System`, or `System::Privileged` (peer creds
   via `SO_PEERCRED`, uid > 4999 must match). We found one gate-passing caller
   (`org.tizen.litewebappservice` → `launch_app(..., payload s, ...)`) but have
   not yet proven its `payload`/app_control reaches the pool bundle to inject
   `__AUL_LOADER_PATH__`. See [App Launch Pool](docs/attack-surface/10-app-launch-pool.md).
2. **World-open `/dev/i2c-*` ioctls** — exposed to uid 5001; classic 4.1.10
   SoC-driver bug class, needs controlled fuzzing. See
   [Kernel Assessment](docs/attack-surface/07-kernel.md).
3. **Unidentified root listener on port 15500** — not yet mapped to a daemon.
4. **Offline firmware patch / reflash** — inject `ps_*` credential XML, patch a
   root daemon, or ship a persistent root helper in the extracted rootfs.
   This is our most promising remaining lane and the least worked.
5. **SMACK / kdbus expertise** — Samsung's kdbus fork reply-lifetime audit, or
   SMACK label-transition quirks that could yield a label/uid transition.

Every avenue we already ruled out is documented in
[Status & Plan](docs/status/11-status.md). **Status of anything that works:
tell us and we'll ship it in tizenMngr.**

## Tools

- [tools/tv.sh](tools/tv.sh) — run a shell command on the TV via the widget
  exec endpoint (`TV_IP=192.168.1.145 ./tools/tv.sh '<cmd>'`). Requires the
  widget service (`kdbuswgt01`) installed and running on the TV.

## Headline Findings

- The TV's **SFD-UEP** kernel module signature-gates *every* `execve`/`mmap` of
  code on writable filesystems (RSA-2048). No unsigned native code can run from
  `/tmp`, `/var`, `/opt`, or `/home`. Loop-mounted read-only squashfs is **not**
  a bypass — UEP is per-file.
- **Owner foothold achieved:** widget service command exec + signed `/usr/bin/node`
  (uid 5001) + kdbus D-Bus via `dbus-send`/`busctl`.
- **Root not achieved** on FW 1410 after exhaustive D-Bus sweep: ps_* daemons
  load **no credential XML** (all `CallCommand` auth-rejected); pkgmgr admin
  enforced; kfactory is factory-register I/O only; confirmed sandbox impact is
  **reboot DoS** + **ungated factory NVRAM tampering**.
- The app-launch-pool "native-exec unlock" **does not escalate**: the pool runs
  as uid 5001 (not 200), its children are uid 5001 CapEff=0, and its SMACK
  peer gate rejects the widget. See [App Launch Pool](docs/attack-surface/10-app-launch-pool.md).
- Kernel module signing is **off**, but `ps_insmod` never runs without ps_*
  whitelist config — theoretical insmod chain blocked at daemon auth.
- Kernel CVEs (Dirty COW, etc.) remain **in range** but gated behind the UEP
  native-exec wall unless exploiting via driver/ioctl or offline firmware patch.
